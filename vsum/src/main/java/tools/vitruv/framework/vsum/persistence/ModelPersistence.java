 * <p>A virtual model calls the methods in this order: {@link #load} once when it is built; for
 * each propagation the change hooks in the order the changes are applied to the models ({@link
 * #changeApplied} for the propagated change, {@link #changeRecorded} for each consequential change
 * recorded while change propagation specifications run), then {@link #propagationFinished} and

 * notifications only: the models already contain the change when a hook is called.
 *
 * <p>Implementations must not keep state that belongs to one virtual model unless they are only
 * used for that virtual model; the context is passed to every call.
